adventure thirsting

heart beaming and swooning

out of bounds and running free

the way to be is a way i cant now see

full force at it, into the sandstorm

tilt torque crashes, our face becomes war-torn

a sunbleached wasteland proved

holy training tribunal

mecca proving ground

swallows screams the soun-

those grinning are the ones winning

where Ive always been an impostor

but acting is as does actor

and this mask keeps me from tearing a face off

tis enough rhyme to be cast away or cast off

marooning myself in a send off

as i make a chivalrous circus out of anew

a landmine opening

invites you roaring

smithereens or glory

tis a lovely day

skeletons fighting 

with sticks over sand

the eternal congress is a mental demand

shamans self fillet and brahmans obey

to cope theres a way

inside out and salt pouring in

the definitions of loss make for so little win

barbaric necessity make beings into monstruous

shadow feinds walking the earth on stilts

while no one sleeps less alert

in a keen sense

one walks the eye

while a sandship soars in forgiving sky

a reigning standoff

with destiny vs fate

our sisters wage to open a gate

the mist of late has taken a bow

souls too pressured to see into the now

spirits collide and fanatics stew

holy chaos brims in an evil witches brew
