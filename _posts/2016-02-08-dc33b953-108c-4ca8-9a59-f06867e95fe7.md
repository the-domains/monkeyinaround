Feeling full of depth

My meth

Made in poisedons lair

With unicorn hair

So  high only i can be reached by Thor

Makes you want more

a wet seal full of zeal

A bat mobile come fly you by

Rehab I cause goes high and wide

Palms carry my travels

And I marvels

As I bleed depths grow to infinity

And beyond the blonde

My mind grows in yogic concentric circles 

And my yoga turns into yoda

Sippin on soda

Shorts and hoodie as I lay on the beach

You think me strange

Or at least high

The drug of the mind is a fine surprise if you find yourself being dined 

by fancy butlers in black lines

and silver hair

We need to think, be fine, benign and unwind

With Wine cooler divine

I just turned on genius mode

This is why we bleed don't ya know

Narcotic like awe and wicked flow

Wonderment ablaze

The wonders of the universe surround and amaze

Wonder woman inside me doesn't wear blue and red

But shorts and a hoodie. And bright orange sunglasses.

I need to see strange purple flowers

With petals like this (wiggly fingers)

The culmination of wisdom and rocket science 

Spews from my subconscious

Taming the whizzing wasps

Untangling the fly fishing line

Concentration remixed

And recalibrated

To a future self of semi fortune

In a shiny silver suit of silver bullets you could kill a werewolf with but wouldn't want to in order to team up and destroy evil 

And be unbelievable
